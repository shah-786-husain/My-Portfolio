      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        I am a Computer Science Engineering graduate with hands-on experience in
        building full-stack and frontend-focused web applications using React.js
        and the MERN stack. I enjoy creating clean, responsive user interfaces
        and translating business requirements into functional, scalable
        solutions. Through academic projects and my MERN Stack internship, I
        have worked on authentication systems, dashboards, REST APIs, and
        data-driven applications. I am currently seeking an opportunity as a
        Frontend Developer or MERN Stack Developer where I can contribute,
        learn, and grow in a professional development environment.
